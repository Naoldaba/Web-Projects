                <h1>MERCURY</h1>
                <p>Mercury is the closest planet to
                the sun and the smallest planet in the 
                solar system — it is only a little larger 
                than Earth's moon. Mercury zips around the 
                sun in only 88 days and because it is so 
                close to our star (about two-fifths the 
                distance between Earth and the sun).
                Mercury experiences dramatic changes in 
                its day and night temperatures. Mercury 
                temperatures can reach a scorching 840 F 
                (450 C) in the day, which is hot enough 
                to melt lead. Meanwhile, on the night side, 
                temperatures drop to minus 290 F (minus 180 C).</p>
                <p>Mercury's atmosphere is very thin and primarily 
                composed of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium and 
                potassium. Because the atmosphere is so thin it 
                cannot incoming meteors, its surface is therefore 
                pockmarked with craters, just like our moon. </p>

                the sun and is the hottest planet 
                in the solar system. Its thick atmosphere 
                is extremely toxic and composed of sulfuric 
                acid clouds, the planet is an extreme

                <p>The average temperature on Venus' 
                surface is 900 F (465 C). At 92 bar, 
                the pressure at the surface would crush 
                and kill you. And oddly, Venus spins 
                slowly from east to west, the opposite 
                direction of most of the other planets.</p>
                <p>Venus is sometimes referred to as Earth's 
                twin as they are similar in size and radar

                <h1>MARS</h1>
                <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the 
                sun. It is a cold, desert-like planet 
                covered in iron oxide dust that gives 
                the planet its signature red hue. Mars 
                shares similarities with Earth: It is 
                rocky, has mountains, valleys and canyons, 
                and storm systems ranging from localized 
                tornado-like dust devils to planet-engulfing 
                dust storms. </p>
                <p>Substantial scientific evidence suggests 
                that Mars at one point billions of years ago 
                was a much warmer, wetter world, rivers and 
                maybe even oceans existed. Although Mars' 
                atmosphere is too thin for liquid water to 
                exist on the surface for any length of time, 
                remnants of that wetter Mars still exist today. 
                 </p>
                <p>Scientists also think ancient Mars would 
                have had the conditions to support life like 
                bacteria and other microbes. Hope that signs 
                of this past life — and the possibility of even 
                current lifeforms — may exist on the Red Planet 
                has driven numerous Mars missions and the Red 
                Planet is now one of the most explored planets 
                in the solar system.</p>

                <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the sun and is famous for its large and distinct ring system. Though Saturn is not the only planet in the solar system with rings.  </p>
                <p>When polymath Galileo Galilei first studied Saturn in the early 1600s, he thought it was an object with three parts: a planet and two large moons on either side. Not knowing he was seeing a planet with rings, the stumped astronomer entered a small drawing — a symbol with one large circle and two smaller ones — in his notebook, as a noun in a sentence describing his discovery. More than 40 years later, Christiaan Huygens proposed that they were rings. </p>
                <p>The rings are made of ice and rock and scientists are not yet sure how they formed. The gaseous planet is mostly hydrogen and helium and has numerous moons.</p>

                <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the sun and is a bit of an oddball. 
                    It has clouds made of hydrogen sulfide, the same chemical that makes rotten eggs smell so foul. It rotates from east to west like Venus. But unlike Venus or any other planet, its equator is nearly at right angles to its orbit — it basically orbits on its side. </p>
                <p>Astronomers believe an object twice the size of Earth collided with Uranus roughly 4 billion years ago, causing Uranus to tilt. That tilt causes extreme seasons that last 20-plus years, and the sun beats down on one pole or the other for 84 Earth-years at a time. </p>
                <p>The collision is also thought to have knocked rock and ice into Uranus' orbit. These later became some of the planet's 27 moons. Methane in Uranus' atmosphere gives the planet its blue-green tint. It also has 13 sets of faint rings.</p>

                <p>Neptune was the first planet predicted to exist by using math, rather than being visually detected. Irregularities in the orbit of Uranus led French astronomer Alexis Bouvard to suggest some other planet might be exerting a gravitational tug.
