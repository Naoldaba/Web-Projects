                <p>The Establishment of Ethiopian Space Science and 
                Technology Institute (ESSTI) and Council are Approved</p>
                <p>On October 14, 2016, the Council of Ministers 
                approved the Establishment of Ethiopian Space Science and Technology 
                Institute and Council, pursuant to article 5 and 39 of the Definition
                 of Powers and Duties of the Executive Organs of the Federal Democratic
                  Republic of Ethiopia proclamation No. 916/2015.</p>
                <p>The main objectives of Establishment of Ethiopian Space Science 
                and Technology Institute(ESSTI) are to enable the country to fully 
                exploit multidimensional uses of space science and technologies; to 
                produce demand based knowledgeable, skilled and attitudinally matured 
                professionals matured professionals in the field of aerospace science
                 that enable the country to become internationally competitive in 
                 the sector; to develop and strengthen space science and technology
                  infrastructures to speed up space science and technology development 
                  in the country; and enable the country to be robust contributor for 
                  the development of aerospace science and technology.</p>
                <p>The Space Council will have power and duties to
                 provide directions and leadership support by evaluating 
                 space science policies, plans and strategies. It will also 
                 provide the necessary guidance and support for the proper and 
                 timely implementation of the Space Science and Technology plans of ESSTI.</p>
                <p>The Approval of the ESSTI is one big step forward for the development 
                of Ethiopian Space Science activities that will give advantage for Ethiopia
                 to be effective and extensive user of space science and technology for its 
                 sustainable developments.</p>

                <p>Stars are the most widely recognized astronomical
                    objects, and represent the most fundamental building 
                    blocks of galaxies. The age, distribution, and composition 
                    of the stars in a galaxy trace the history, dynamics, 
                    and evolution of that galaxy.</p>

            <div>
                <p>A planet is a large, rounded astronomical 
                    body that is neither a star nor its remnant. 
                    The best available theory of planet formation 
                    is the nebular hypothesis, which posits that 
                    an interstellar cloud collapses out of a nebula 
                    to create a young protostar orbited by a 
                    protoplanetary disk. Planets grow in this disk 
                    by the gradual accumulation of material driven by 
                    gravity, a process called accretion. The Solar 
                    System has at least eight planets: the terrestrial 
                    planets Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, and the giant 
                    planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.</p>

                <p>Did you know that our star, the Sun, is just one 
                    of hundreds of billions of stars swirling within 
                    an enormous cosmic place called the Milky Way 
                    Galaxy? The Milky Way is a huge collection of stars, 
                    dust and gas. It's called a spiral galaxy because if 
                    you could view it from the top or bottom, it would 
                    look like a spinning pinwheel. The Sun is located on 
                    one of the spiral arms, about 25,000 light-years away 
                    from the center of the galaxy. Even if you could travel 
                    at the speed of light (300,000 kilometers, or 186,000
                    miles, per second), it would take you about 25,000 
                    years to reach the middle of the Milky Way.</p>

                <p>Black hole, cosmic body of extremely intense 
                    gravity from which nothing, not even light, 
                    can escape. A black hole can be formed by 
                    the death of a massive star. When such a 
                    star has exhausted the internal thermonuclear 
                    fuels in its core at the end of its life, 
                    the core becomes unstable and gravitationally 
                    collapses inward upon itself, and the star's o
                    uter layers are blown away. The crushing weight 
                    of constituent matter falling in from all sides 
                    compresses the dying star to a point of zero volume 
                    and infinite density called the singularity.</p>
